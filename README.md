# TikTok Content Classification Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning system** to classify TikTok content into two categories:  
- **Claim** (factual statement or assertion)  
- **Opinion** (subjective viewpoint)  

The project involves the **full machine learning pipeline**â€”from **data cleaning and transformation** to **hypothesis testing, model building, and deployment**. Finally, the model is integrated into a **web application** using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals  
- Develop a reliable classifier that can distinguish between **claims** and **opinions** in TikTok videos.  
- Apply **data preprocessing and transformation techniques** to prepare text data for modeling.  
- Perform **hypothesis testing** to validate assumptions about the dataset.  
- Build, evaluate, and fine-tune **ML models** for text classification.  
- Deploy a simple, interactive **Streamlit app** to showcase predictions.
